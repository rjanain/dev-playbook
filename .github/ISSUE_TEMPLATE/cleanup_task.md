**Target for Cleanup**
Which file(s) or section(s) need to be removed or updated?
- [ ] Obsolete Documentation
- [ ] Deprecated Code/Feature
- [ ] Old Branch
- [ ] Other

**Path/Location**
`path/to/file/or/section`

**Reason for Removal**
Why is this no longer needed? (e.g., Feature X was removed in v2.0, so `docs/feature-x.md` is obsolete).

**Replacement (if applicable)**
Is there new documentation or code that replaces this? Link it here.

**Checklist**
- [ ] I have verified that this is not referenced elsewhere.
- [ ] I have checked if this affects any build scripts.
